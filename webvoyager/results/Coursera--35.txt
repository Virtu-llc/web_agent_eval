Lead instructor:
- Name: George J. Hochmuth, Ph.D.
- Affiliation: Professor, University of Florida
- Instructor profile page: https://www.coursera.org/instructor/hochmuth

Instructor background (from the Coursera bio page):
- Focus: Research program in urban and agricultural fertilization and nutrient management practices.
- Expertise and research themes: Environmental science questions tied to water quality; integrated nutrient and water management in urban and agricultural settings; Florida’s water supply and quality challenges; efficient irrigation technologies; alternative water sources; and improved water management practices.
- Nutrient emphasis: Careful management of fertilizer nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) to avoid environmental losses; keeping nutrients and water in the plant root zone.
- Typical research questions include:
  - Sources (nutrient budgets) of nutrients in groundwater and surface water in agricultural and urban settings.
  - How irrigation and fertilization practices work together to prevent nitrogen losses.
  - Best management practices for nutrient and water retention in the root zone.
  - Development of tools (plant/soil testing meters, application devices, software) to improve nutrient and water management.
  - Crop/landscape cultivars efficient in nutrient uptake and utilization; roles of crop selection, rotation, cover-cropping, mulching, irrigation, and fertilization in minimizing nutrient losses; role and BMPs for organic nutrient sources.
- Methods: Greenhouse bench-scale studies; field-scale studies in residential landscapes and on farms; hydroponics to study nutrient uptake and utilization.
