Result found in BBC Travel > World’s Table:
- Food pictured: Kvikk Lunsj (a Norwegian chocolate bar)
- Region: Norway

What I did:
- Navigated to BBC News, opened the Travel section, scrolled to the “World’s Table” area, and identified the tile “The controversial snack that fuels Norwegian trips,” which displays a picture of the Kvikk Lunsj chocolate bar in the snow and explicitly references Norway.
