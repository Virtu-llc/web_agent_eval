What I did
- Navigated to dictionary.cambridge.org
- Opened the Cambridge Dictionary +Plus section
- Launched the Word Scramble game (+Plus > Games > Word Scramble)
- Opened the inâ€‘page game overlay and made an initial attempt on the first puzzle (typed and submitted an answer to try to beat the clock)

Screenshot
- I captured the screen after my first attempt inside the game overlay:

Notes
- The game runs inside an overlay iframe on the +Plus page; I clicked into the game, typed an answer, and submitted it to try the first example, then took the final screenshot.
