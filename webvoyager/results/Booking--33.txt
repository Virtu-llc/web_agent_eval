Here’s what I found on Booking.com’s Help Center under Cancellations:

Question: How do I know if my booking was canceled?
Answer from Booking.com:
- After you cancel a booking with Booking.com, you should receive an email confirming the cancellation.
- Check your inbox and your spam/junk folder.
- If you don’t receive an email within 24 hours, contact the property to confirm they received your cancellation.

What I did:
- Opened booking.com and navigated via the site header to Customer support (Help Center).
- Opened Frequently asked questions > Cancellations.
- Selected “How do I know if my booking was canceled?” and extracted the official answer.
