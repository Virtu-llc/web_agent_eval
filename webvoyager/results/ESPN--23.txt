Here’s what I found on ESPN:

- Matchup: Miami Heat at New York Knicks
- Date: March 17, 2025 (Madison Square Garden)
- Final Score: Knicks 116, Heat 95
- Top Rebounder: Josh Hart (Knicks) — 13 rebounds

Source path on ESPN:
- I used the ESPN search suggestions to open the recap, then navigated to the Box Score for gameId 401705550 (Knicks 116-95 Heat). The box score table shows Josh Hart with 13 rebounds, the most in the game, and the scoreboard confirms the final score 116-95.
