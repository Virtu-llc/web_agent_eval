Here’s what I found on BBC News after navigating to the Artificial Intelligence section:

Top headline (from the Artificial Intelligence section):
- New AI deal could rapidly boost UK economy, says Microsoft boss

Companies involved (as named in the top story’s article):
- Microsoft

Notes:
- The top story describes a major AI investment package tied to the UK, with Microsoft’s $30bn component and additional investments/initiatives from Google and Nvidia. It also references the “Stargate UK” data centre project involving OpenAI, Nvidia, Arm, and Nscale.
