Task accomplished on Wolfram|Alpha: Queried “geomagnetic field on June 20, 2023 in Oslo” and captured the results.

What I found (Assuming Oslo, Norway; date Tuesday, June 20, 2023):
- Magnetic declination: 4.51° E
- Magnetic dip (inclination): 72.888°
- Geomagnetic field strength (predicted values from WMM 2020, excluding local perturbations):
  - Total field: +51.5 μT
  - x component (north): +15.1 μT
  - y component (east): +1.19 μT
  - z component (down): +49.2 μT
