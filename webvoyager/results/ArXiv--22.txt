Task completed.

What I did
- Visited arXiv.org and navigated to the Help section.
- Located the “Email subscriptions for new papers” help page with instructions on subscribing to daily listing emails for new submissions in specific categories.
- Took a screenshot of the final page with the instructions.

Where the instructions are
- Page title: Email subscriptions for new papers
- URL: https://info.arxiv.org/help/subscribe.html

Instructions (as shown on the page)
- Important email format
  - The subscription request email must be plain ASCII text.
  - Rich text emails will be ignored.
  - UTF-8 characters in the Subject field will be ignored.

- Determine the archive and address
  - Determine which archive you want and obtain its email address from the list of available archives.

- If the archive is divided into subject classes (e.g., math, physics, cs, q-bio, q-fin)
  - You subscribe to a specific category by including the category in the body.
  - Example (subscribe to Biophysics and unsubscribe from Plasma Physics via physics):
    - To: physics@arxiv.org
    - Subject: subscribe John Smith
    - add Biophysics
    - del Plasma Physics
  - You may use short subject class codes. Example (subscribe to Risk Management q-fin.RM):
    - To: q-fin@arxiv.org
    - Subject: subscribe John Smith
    - add RM

- If the archive is NOT divided into subject classes
  - Send an email:
    - To: arch-ive@arxiv.org
    - Subject: subscribe Your Full Name
  - Example (subscribe to the entire quant-ph archive):
    - To: quant-ph@arxiv.org
    - Subject: subscribe John Smith
  - Note: For subdivided archives like cond-mat, this form subscribes you to ALL subject classes in that archive.

- Handling subsets within the physics family (including astro-ph, cond-mat, nlin)
  - Use the physics archive to subscribe to any combination or subset.
  - Example (subscribe only to Soft Condensed Matter and Superconductivity within cond-mat):
    - To: physics@arxiv.org
    - Subject: subscribe John Smith
    - add Soft Condensed Matter
    - add Superconductivity
  - If changing from all of astro-ph to just astro-ph.EP:
    - First cancel the astro-ph subscription, then subscribe to EP via physics.

- Cancel your subscription
  - To cancel:
    - To: arch-ive@arxiv.org
    - Subject: cancel
  - For canceling a specific subject class in classified archives, use del in the subscribe command as shown above.
  - If you’re subscribed via a remote listserv or local distribution list, you must contact that list’s administrator (check headers in your daily mailing to determine origin).
