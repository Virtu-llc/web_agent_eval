Here’s travel inspiration gathered directly from a Booking.com travel article: “The 9 most beautiful beaches in the US.” I visited the article and summarized three of the featured places below.

Summaries of places mentioned
- Driftwood Beach, Georgia (Jekyll Island)
  - Why it stands out: An eerie-beautiful shoreline shaped by erosion, with sun-bleached, gnarled driftwood scattered across smooth sand. Sunsets are particularly striking, and at low tide, small tidal pools around the driftwood reveal crabs and other sea life.
- Pfeiffer Beach, California (Big Sur)
  - Why it stands out: Known for its metallic purple-tinted sand created by manganese deposits from nearby hillsides, this otherworldly beach offers dramatic coastal scenery and a unique, photogenic shoreline.
- Miami’s South Beach, Florida
  - Why it stands out: Iconic white-sand beach with turquoise water, an energetic vibe, and classic Art Deco backdrops. Beyond sunbathing and water sports, you’ll find Latin-influenced dining and nightlife, plus colorful lifeguard towers that are local landmarks.

Other places highlighted in the article (not summarized above)
- Folly Beach, South Carolina
- Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina (Outer Banks)
- Siesta Key Beach, Florida (near Sarasota)
- Gulf Shores, Alabama
- Waikiki Beach, Hawaii
- Oxnard Beach Park, California
