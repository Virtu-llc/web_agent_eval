Actions performed:
- Visited arXiv and opened the paper “Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering” (arXiv:2004.04906).
- Downloaded/opened the PDF via the “View PDF” link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04906
- Opened the HTML rendering (ar5iv) to reliably count math expressions and extract the loss formula.
- Counted all formula elements and identified the loss function equation.

Results:
- Number of formulas in the article: 118 (count of all MathML <math> elements in the HTML rendering)
- Loss function (as given in the Training section):
  - LaTeX: \displaystyle -\log\frac{e^{\mathrm{sim}(q_{i},p_{i}^{+})}}{e^{\mathrm{sim}(q_{i},p_{i}^{+})}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}{e^{\mathrm{sim}(q_{i},p^{-}_{i,j})}}}.
  - This corresponds to the negative log-likelihood over the positive passage vs. in-batch (and optional BM25) negatives, where sim(q,p) = E_Q(q)^T E_P(p).
