Result:
- I navigated to BBC News, opened the Business area, and reached the Market Data page.
- Current status on the Market Data page: “The BBC has discontinued its market data feeds on both the website and red button (UK only) services.”
- There is no market data provider listed, because the BBC no longer supplies market data in this format.
