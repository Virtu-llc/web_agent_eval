  - Around Proxima Centauri (Alpha Centauri C):
    - Confirmed: Proxima Centauri b, Proxima Centauri d
    - Candidate (disputed): Proxima Centauri c
  - Around Alpha Centauri A (Rigil Kentaurus): A possible Saturn‑mass planet is suggested but not confirmed.
  - Around Alpha Centauri B (Toliman): No known planets.
  - Sources (on pages):
    - “Proxima Centauri has two known exoplanets and one candidate exoplanet: Proxima Centauri b, Proxima Centauri d and the disputed Proxima Centauri c.” (Proxima Centauri - Wikipedia)
    - “Proxima Centauri has two confirmed planets — Proxima b and Proxima d … A possible but disputed third planet, Proxima c … Rigil Kentaurus may have a Saturn-mass planet … Toliman has no known planets.” (Alpha Centauri - Wikipedia)
