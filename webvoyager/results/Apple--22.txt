Here’s what I did and found:

- Navigated to apple.com > Apple Trade In
- Opened the Trade-In estimator (Get your estimate)
- Chose: Smartphone > Apple > iPhone 13 Pro Max
- Condition: Yes — My phone is in good condition

Result on Apple’s website:
- Trade-in credit toward a new iPhone: $320
- Or Apple Gift Card credit: $305

I’ve captured a screenshot of the final result for your reference. Filename: test_cases/result_with_screenshot_small/Apple--22/screenshot_1758056662.png
