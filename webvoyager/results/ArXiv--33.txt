Paper
- Title: Merging Physics-Based Synthetic Data and Machine Learning for Thermal Monitoring of Lithium-ion Batteries: The Role of Data Fidelity
- arXiv ID: 2509.10380
- Category context: cs.SY (cross-listed; primary category eess.SY)

Main objective/hypothesis
- Objective: Develop an accurate, robust, and real-time framework for estimating the internal temperature of lithium-ion batteries by blending physics-based modeling with machine learning.
- Approach:
  - Generate diverse, physics-based synthetic simulation data (via parameter and input sweeps) to pre-train an ML estimator on the underlying mapping.
  - Apply transfer learning with unsupervised domain adaptation to adapt the model using limited in-service data (without internal temperature labels) from target batteries, bridging the simulation-to-reality gap.
- Findings: The framework achieves ~0.5 °C RMSE using only prior thermal property knowledge and <0.1 °C when thermal parameters are close to ground truth; the quality (fidelity) of synthetic data critically influences ML performance.
