I visited Wolfram|Alpha and performed the query. The site interpreted “now” as 2025 US dollars and gave CPI-based conversions.

Results (from Wolfram|Alpha):
- $10,000 (2025 USD) in 1980 dollars: $2,634.31 (based on Consumer Price Index)
- $10,000 (2025 USD) in 1970 dollars: $1,241.10 (based on Consumer Price Index)
