Here are the thermal conductivities at 25°C from Wolfram|Alpha:

- Copper (Cu): 401.2 W/(m·K)
- Aluminum (Al): 236.9 W/(m·K)

Action taken:
- Visited https://www.wolframalpha.com/
- Queried for “thermal conductivity of copper at 25 C” and “thermal conductivity of aluminum at 25 C”
- Extracted results from the Wolfram|Alpha result pages
- Captured a screenshot of the final result page
