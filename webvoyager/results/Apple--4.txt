Here’s the price I found on Apple.com for the requested configuration:

- Product: 16‑inch MacBook Pro
- Chip: Apple M4 Max with 16‑core CPU, 40‑core GPU
- Memory: 48GB unified memory (default for this config)
- Storage: 1TB SSD
- Price: $3,999.00 (or $333.25/mo. for 12 months with Apple Card Monthly Installments)

I navigated to the 16‑inch model, selected the M4 Max (16‑core CPU, 40‑core GPU) with 1TB SSD configuration, and captured the price shown on the customization page.
