Here’s what I did and found:

Steps taken:
- Opened ESPN and navigated to the NBA section, including the NBA Transactions page.
- Used ESPN’s site search (query: “NBA trade”) and opened the “Articles” results (See All).
- Reviewed the most recent “trade” result cards and opened the most relevant trade headline.

Findings:
- The most recent ESPN article directly about an NBA trade I could locate is:
  - Title: Hawks trading Kobe Bufkin to Nets for cash, sources say
  - Article date on ESPN: Sep 15, 2025, 04:47 PM ET
  - This date is more than two days ago.
- I also reviewed the current NBA news feed items (timestamps such as 12h, 1d, 2d, etc.) on ESPN’s NBA pages; none of the items within the past 48 hours were about an NBA trade.

Conclusion:
- Based on ESPN’s pages and search results reviewed just now, there are no new ESPN articles reporting an NBA trade within the past 2 days.
- The latest clearly trade-focused piece is the Bufkin-to-Nets story, but it was published on Sep 15, 2025 (outside the 2‑day window).

Screenshot:
- I captured a screenshot showing the article page (with headline and the article date visible).
