Done. Here’s what I completed:
- Opened Google Flights
- Set trip type to One way
- Searched for flights from Mumbai (BOM) to Vancouver (YVR)
- Set departure date to Friday, November 28, 2025
- Applied Stops filter to “1 stop or fewer” (which results in only 1‑stop flights for this route)
- Confirmed results updated (page shows “10 results returned.” and the Stops chip shows “1 stop or fewer”)
