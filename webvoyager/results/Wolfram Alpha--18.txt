Task completed:
- Opened https://www.wolframalpha.com/
- Entered and submitted the query. The initial phrasing was interpreted ambiguously by Wolfram|Alpha, so I refined it to “parametric plot of Albert Einstein curve” to obtain the correct plot.
- Located the “Result” plot on the results page, adjusted the viewport to show the full graph, and captured a screenshot.
