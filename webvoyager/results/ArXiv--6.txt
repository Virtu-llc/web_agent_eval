Here’s what I did:
- Visited arxiv.org, searched by title, and opened the paper’s abstract page: “On the Sentence Embeddings from Pre-trained Language Models” (arXiv:2011.05864).
- From there, I viewed the HTML rendering (arXiv’s ar5iv HTML view) to reliably extract the counts of labeled Figures and Tables from the document structure.
- Counted labeled items using the document’s anchors and captions.

Result:
- Figures: 2
- Tables: 8

Screenshot: Saved a screenshot of the HTML rendering at the final step.
