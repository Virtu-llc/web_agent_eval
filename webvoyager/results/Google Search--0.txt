Result: Initial release date — April 22, 2023

What I did:
- Visited https://www.google.com/
- Searched for “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 initial release date”
- On the Google results page, the Wikipedia snippet states “premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023,” indicating the initial release date.

Note:
- The Google Knowledge Panel also shows “Release date: May 5, 2023 (USA)” for the U.S. theatrical release, but the initial release (premiere) is April 22, 2023.
