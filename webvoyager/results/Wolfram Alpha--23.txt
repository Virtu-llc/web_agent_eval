I used Wolfram Alpha to compute Canada’s population growth rate for 2020–2023 and captured the result.

What I did:
- Opened Wolfram Alpha and searched: “population growth rate of Canada from 2020 to 2023”
- Extracted the Result pod values shown by Wolfram Alpha

Wolfram Alpha results:
- Input interpretation: Canada | population growth | 2020 to 2023
- Result:
  - Mean growth rate: 0.9886 %/yr (percent per year)
  - Lowest annual rate: 0.7392 %/yr (2021)
  - Highest annual rate: 1.231 %/yr (2023) — 2023 estimate
