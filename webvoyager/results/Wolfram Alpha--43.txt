Here’s what I did and found on Wolfram|Alpha:

- Query used: “polyominoes of order 6 two-sided”
- Result pods observed: Input interpretation (polyomino | order 6 including orientation (2-sided)), Count, Base cell shape, and Images (showing all hexominoes).

Results extracted from the page:
- Total number of (two-sided/free) hexominoes: 35
  - This is shown in the “Count” pod (image label “35”).

- Among the displayed shapes, how many have only 2 rows in total: 10
  - I examined the full “Images” panel (expanded via “More” and “Enlarge”) and counted the hexominoes whose occupied cells span exactly two rows (i.e., their bounding height is 2 unit squares). This includes the 2×3 rectangle and nine other two-row configurations.

Screenshot
- I took a screenshot of the expanded results page (showing the pods and the shapes panel).

Summary
- Total combinations (two-sided, order 6): 35
- Number of those with only 2 rows: 10
- Screenshot captured at the final step.
