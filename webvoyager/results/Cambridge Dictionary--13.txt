Here’s what I found on Cambridge Dictionary (euphoria entry) under “SMART Vocabulary: related words and phrases” (Pleasure and happiness):

- Word: joy
- Phrase: for fun (labelled “phrase”)
- Idiom: bed of roses (labelled “idiom”)

I’ve taken a screenshot of the page showing the related words/phrases section.
