Here’s what I accomplished:

1) Opened Google Flights and set up your trip
- Trip type: One-way
- From: Johannesburg (JNB)
- To: Toronto (YYZ)
- Date: Friday, January 30, 2026
- Passengers: 1 adult
- Confirmed the results page showing one-way JNB → Toronto for Jan 30, 2026.

2) Analyzed price trends for the following month (February 2026)
I used the “Date grid” inside “Price insights” to read daily prices across February 2026. Below is what the grid showed for one-way JNB → Toronto:

If you’d like, I can extract a full list of dates/prices for all of February or pivot to the “Price graph” view for a different visual on the same trend.
