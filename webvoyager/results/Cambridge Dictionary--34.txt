What I found on Cambridge Dictionary (English Grammar Today):

Definitions and basic use
- Comparative adjectives: compare one person/thing with another; show more or less of a quality
  - Examples: 
    - Josh is taller than his sister.
    - I’m more interested in music than sport.
    - Big cars that use a lot of petrol are less popular now than twenty years ago.
- Superlative adjectives: describe one person/thing as having more of a quality than all others in a group
  - Examples:
    - The ‘Silver Arrow’ will be the fastest train in the world when it is built.
    - The most frightening film I’ve ever seen was Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Psycho’.
    - What is the least expensive way of travelling in Japan?
- Comparative vs superlative
  - Comparative compares two: Joe’s older than Mike.
  - Superlative compares with the whole group: Sheila is the youngest girl in the family.
  - With only two in the group, traditional usage prefers the comparative (Who is younger, Rowan or Tony?), though informal speech sometimes uses the superlative (Jan’s the tallest).

Forming comparatives and superlatives

1) One-syllable adjectives (big, cold, hot, long, nice, old, tall)
- Comparative: add -er
  - It’s colder today than yesterday.
  - It was a longer holiday than the one we had last year.
- Superlative: add -est (usually with the)
  - I think that’s the biggest apple I’ve ever seen!
  - … was the tallest building in the world.
  - Richard is the oldest and Simon is the youngest.

Spelling patterns (one syllable)
- Most adjectives: cheaper/cheapest; richer/richest
- Ending in -e: finer/finest; nicer/nicest
- One vowel + one consonant: double final consonant (bigger/biggest; hotter/hottest; thinner/thinnest)

Irregular one-syllable adjectives
- bad, worse, worst
  - I think that was the worst film I’ve ever seen!
- far, farther/further, farthest/furthest
  - Pluto is the furthest planet from the sun in our solar system.
- good, better, best
  - The morning flight is better than the afternoon one.
- old, older/elder, oldest/eldest
  - His elder sister works for the government.
- Warning: do not use more/most with -er/-est forms
  - They are looking for a better life. Not: a more better life
  - One of the biggest. Not: the most biggest

2) Two-syllable adjectives
- Ending in -y: y → i + -er/-est
  - busy, busier, busiest; happy, happier, happiest; easy, easier, easiest; funny, funnier, funniest
  - We were busier last week than this week.
  - Are you happier now …?
  - That was the easiest exam I’ve ever taken.
- Some other two-syllables (especially with an unstressed final vowel) can take -er/-est:
  - cleverer/cleverest; quieter/quietest; narrower/narrowest; simpler/simplest
  - I’ve always thought Donald was cleverer than his brother.
- Adjectives ending in -ful: use more/most/least, not -er/-est
  - more useful (Not: usefuller)
  - more careful; the most useful; the least harmful

3) Longer adjectives (three or more syllables)
- Comparative: more/less + adjective
  - The second lecture was more interesting than the first.
  - That way … seems less complicated to me.
- Superlative: most/least + adjective
  - London is the most popular tourist destination in England.
  - The least expensive option is to rent an apartment.

Using comparatives and superlatives

- Intensifying or softening comparatives
  - Stronger: much/a lot/far/even/rather + comparative; or comparative + than ever
    - This food is much better than the food we had yesterday.
    - The town is a lot more crowded these days …
    - Alex is far less intelligent than the other kids …
    - We’ve been busier than ever …
  - Softer: a little/a bit + comparative
    - She feels a little more confident now …
- Using than
  - Use than before the second item; with pronouns, use object forms in neutral style
    - You’re stronger than me. (neutral) In formal style: … than I am.
    - Marie is more experienced than him. (formal: … than he was.)
- Increasing change
  - -er and -er: The weather is getting hotter and hotter.
  - more and more: I’m getting more and more interested in conservation …
- Parallel increases (the …, the …)
  - The colder it is, the hungrier I get.
  - The more generous you are … the more generous they are …
- Reduced forms after comparatives (avoid repeating predictable parts)
  - The exam results were better than predicted.
  - Temperatures … were higher than previously recorded.
- Less and not as/not so …
  - Use less with longer adjectives: The second method was less complicated …
  - For short adjectives, prefer not as/not so … as: This new laptop is not as fast as my old one. (preferable to “less fast”)
- Prepositions after superlatives
  - With singular place/group names use in, not of:
    - The oldest building in the city. Not: of the city
    - The youngest musician in the orchestra.
  - Use of with plural group words:
    - … the prettiest of them all.
- The with superlatives
  - Before a noun: use the
    - This is the best meal I’ve had for a long time.
  - Informally, after linking/sense verbs and without a noun, the can be omitted:
    - Which looks best?
    - Email is quickest.
- Other determiners with superlatives
  - Possessives and numbers possible:
    - My worst score ever …
    - the second biggest city …
    - His two best friends …
- Emphasising superlatives: by far, easily, of all; (formal) quite
  - by far the most successful …
  - by far the least complicated
  - easily the best dancer …
  - the best poem of all …
  - quite the most irresponsible behaviour …
- To-infinitives after superlatives
  - the oldest person to compete …
  - the largest sailing-ship ever to be used in battle

Typical errors to avoid
- Use than after comparatives (not that/as):
  - more expensive than the first one. Not: that/as the first one
- With singular place/group names, don’t use of after a superlative:
  - the tallest girl in the team. Not: of the team
- Use the superlative (not comparative) when comparing more than two:
  - Which is the city’s biggest hotel? Not: bigger hotel
