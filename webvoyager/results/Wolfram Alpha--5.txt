Completed: Queried Wolfram|Alpha for y''(z) + sin(y(z)) = 0, captured the solution, and took a screenshot of the results page.

Differential equation solution (as shown on Wolfram|Alpha):
- y(z) = -2 am(1/2 sqrt((c_1 + 2) (z + c_2)^2), 4/(c_1 + 2))
- y(z) = 2 am(1/2 sqrt((c_1 + 2) (z + c_2)^2), 4/(c_1 + 2))
Note: am(x, m) is the Jacobi amplitude function. The constants c_1 and c_2 are arbitrary.
