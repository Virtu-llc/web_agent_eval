Key insights from the analysis
- City’s 4v2 overload in midfield
  - Pep Guardiola targeted United’s defensive shape by creating a central box around United’s double pivot.
  - Left-back Nico O’Reilly held the touchline to pin United wing-back Noussair Mazraoui, while Jeremy Doku moved inside and Phil Foden dropped deeper alongside Rodri and Tijjani Reijnders.
  - This reproduced a successful pattern previously used against United (e.g., Fulham with Alex Iwobi drifting infield) to outnumber their midfield.

- United’s disjointed press
  - United’s right centre-back Leny Yoro had to step high onto Doku/Foden zones, often retreating to protect the back line, which broke the chain and left City with a spare man.
  - Bruno Fernandes admitted United needed to be “more brave with full pressure”; miscommunication (e.g., on Rodri/Foden assignments) repeatedly opened passing lanes.
  - Result: Foden frequently received under little pressure and carried play forward.

- City’s use of pinning to unlock space
  - “Pinning” (keeping defenders occupied by positioning attackers) blunted United’s aggressive stepping out.
  - O’Reilly pinned Mazraoui; on the opposite side Reijnders occupied Luke Shaw, keeping him anchored to the back five.
  - With Shaw pinned, Doku’s inside positioning allowed him to receive unopposed, turn, and drive—leading to the first goal (Doku assist).

- United’s midfield runners untracked
  - For the opener, United had numbers back (Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte) but failed to track the late midfield run—an issue seen earlier this season (e.g., Fulham’s Emile Smith Rowe).
  - The piece questions whether United are maximizing player strengths: Fernandes’ attacking qualities don’t naturally include tracking late runners, while City smartly used Foden’s timing behind Erling Haaland.

- Adaptability: Guardiola vs Amorim
  - The article argues United’s problems are structural as much as personnel-driven; the same rotations keep exposing their system.
  - Amorim appeared to double down on philosophy post-match (“When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.”), but the squad won’t change before January—suggesting a need to adapt roles or system.
  - Guardiola showed flexibility—e.g., integrating new goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma hinting at a more direct build when needed—keeping the philosophy intact while tailoring the system to players.
