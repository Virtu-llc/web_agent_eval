I completed the search on Google Flights and identified the one-way flight from Calgary to New York on January 1 with the lowest carbon dioxide emissions. I also captured a screenshot at the final step.

Result found (sorted by Emissions = lowest first):
- Airline: Air Canada
- Route: Calgary (YYC) to Newark (EWR)
- Date: Thu, Jan 1 (next Jan 1)
- Times: Departs 8:25 AM, Arrives 3:08 PM
- Stops: Nonstop
- Carbon emissions estimate: 252 kilograms (−22% emissions)
- Price shown: From $469 USD

Note: The emissions figure and “−22%” badge are taken directly from the flight’s listing after sorting by Emissions.
