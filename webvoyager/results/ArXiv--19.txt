Task completed.

Findings:
- Which university maintains and manages arXiv: From arXiv’s About page: “arXiv … is now maintained and operated by Cornell Tech. Operations are maintained by the arXiv Leadership Team and arXiv staff at Cornell University.” In short: Cornell University (via Cornell Tech).
- Undergraduate students (accessed via the university website linked from arXiv): On Cornell University’s About > Quick Facts, the current undergraduate student count is 16,128.

What I did:
- Visited arXiv.org, opened About arXiv, and confirmed the maintenance/management text (Cornell Tech/Cornell University).
- Clicked the “Cornell University” link on that page to reach cornell.edu.
- Navigated to About > Quick Facts and extracted the undergraduate count (16,128).
- Took a screenshot of the Quick Facts section showing the undergraduate number.
