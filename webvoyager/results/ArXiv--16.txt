Brief summary of main findings
- Concept: The paper explores detecting gravitational waves (GWs) via their effect on the time-time component of the metric in asynchronous gaugesâ€”manifesting as a measurable desynchronization between a perturbed clock and a reference clock.
- Approach: The authors survey current high-precision timing technologies and information-preservation methods required to realize geodesic non-locality and evaluate feasibility.
- Prototype concept: They synthesize a feasible detector design targeting timing perturbations, identifying an optimal operational band around ~1 Hz.
- Implications: Such a detector could access sources otherwise challenging for current ground-based observatories, including intermediate-mass black hole binaries, opening a complementary observational window for GW astronomy.
