Here’s what I found on BBC News (via the Weather section’s search):

Article: Storm-damaged port partly closes again for repairs
Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl5kkgz75zo
Source section labels on page: Wales | News (story focuses on storm impacts)

Where and when the severe weather occurred:
- Where: Holyhead (north Wales, UK)
- When: December 2024 — specifically during Storm Darragh (the article and image caption note damage caused in early December 2024)

Key details from the article:
- Two berths at Holyhead Port were damaged during Storm Darragh in December 2024.
- The port fully closed for five weeks, partially reopened in January, and a second berth reopened in July before closing again for maintenance until November.
