What I did:
- Opened https://dictionary.cambridge.org/ and navigated to the Translate section.
- Entered “Hello world” into the Translator input and submitted it to run a translation.
- Identified the translation provider from the widget’s attribution and links (Privacy Policy | Terms of Service) shown beneath the translator.

Result:
- Translation provider: Google (Google Translate)

Screenshot:
- Saved a screenshot of the translator with the result and attribution: test_cases/result_with_screenshot_small/Cambridge Dictionary--19/screenshot_1757988851.png
