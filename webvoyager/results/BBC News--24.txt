Key points summary
- New restriction: NASA has blocked Chinese citizens (even with valid US visas) from accessing its facilities, materials, and networks, effectively preventing them from working with the agency, including at key research centers.
- Reason given: The agency cites security concerns—“to ensure the security of our work”—amid a broader US-China technology and national security rivalry.
- Immediate impact: Chinese nationals involved as contractors or student researchers reportedly found access to NASA systems and meetings suddenly revoked on 5 September.
- Wider context: 
  - US law already prohibits NASA from sharing data with China, which contributes to Chinese astronauts being excluded from the International Space Station.
  - The move further reduces scientific collaboration between the US and China.
- Space race framing: NASA’s acting administrator, Sean Duffy, described the situation as a “second space race,” stating China wants to return to the Moon before the US—“That’s not going to happen.”
- Policy and politics: 
  - US lawmakers (e.g., Sen. Ted Cruz) argue the US must secure “dominant space capabilities,” warning of risks if adversaries take the lead.
  - Chinese officials have called US concerns “unnecessary,” framing China’s space efforts as a “collective mission for humanity.”
- Strategic stakes: The competition is not just about landing on the Moon but also about controlling lunar resources (e.g., minerals and helium) with wide-ranging technological and economic implications.
