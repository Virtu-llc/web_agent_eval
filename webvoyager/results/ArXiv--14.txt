Result: 4 articles

How I found it:
- Searched arXiv for “SimCSE” (All fields).
- Sorted by “Announcement date (newest first)” and reviewed the results page.
- Counted entries that explicitly show “originally announced October 2023.”

The four matching articles:
1) Japanese SimCSE Technical Report (arXiv:2310.19349) — originally announced October 2023
2) Non-contrastive sentence representations via self-supervision (arXiv:2310.17690) — originally announced October 2023
3) Large Language Models can Contrastively Refine their Generation for Better Sentence Representation Learning (arXiv:2310.10962) — originally announced October 2023
4) Improving Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings with Focal-InfoNCE (arXiv:2310.06918) — originally announced October 2023
