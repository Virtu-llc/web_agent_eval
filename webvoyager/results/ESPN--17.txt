Here’s what I found on ESPN’s NBA Basketball Power Index (BPI) for the 2024-25 season:

- First place (BPI Rank 1): Oklahoma City Thunder
- Last place (BPI Rank 30): Washington Wizards

I navigated to the BPI page (season selector shows 2024-25) and verified the table is sorted by BPI Rank. The Thunder are listed first with BPI RK 1, and the Wizards appear at the bottom with BPI RK 30.
