Here’s what I found on Amazon:

Located product
- Product: Gaiam Essentials Premium Yoga Mat with Yoga Mat Carrier Sling, Purple, 72" x 24" x 1/4" Thick
- Price: $19.98
- Rating: 4.6 out of 5 stars
- Thickness: 1/4 inch (6mm) shown in “About this item” and Product Information (“Size: 6mm”)
- Color selected: Purple

Policies
- Returns: FREE Returns (button shown near price)
- Delivery: Get Fast, Free Shipping with Amazon Prime (text shown near price)

Colors available
- The product page shows “Color: Purple,” but it does not display a total count of available colors on this specific listing page. I could not find a clear “X colors” count or a swatch list to count from the page content.

Notes
- All criteria are met: purple color, ≥5mm thickness (6mm), 4+ star rating (4.6), and price under $30.
- If you want, I can try another yoga mat listing that explicitly shows the total number of color options on the page and capture that count as well.
