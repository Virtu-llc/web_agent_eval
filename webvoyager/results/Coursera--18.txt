Task completed: I visited Coursera, searched for beginner JavaScript courses, and verified a course that is beginner-friendly and includes a certificate. I captured a screenshot at the final step.

Identified course
- Title: Programming with JavaScript
- Provider: Meta
- Level shown on page: Beginner level
- Certificate shown on page: Shareable certificate (also “Earn a career certificate” section present)
- URL: https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript

What I verified on the course page
- “Beginner level” is displayed near the top details.
- “Shareable certificate” is listed under “Details to know,” confirming a certificate upon completion.

Notes
- I used Coursera’s search and filters, then navigated to the course page to confirm the level and certificate details directly from the page before taking the screenshot.
