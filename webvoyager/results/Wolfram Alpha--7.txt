I attempted to use Wolfram|Alpha to compute the spring pendulum’s final angle and length at t = 6 s with:
- mass = 1 kg
- spring constant k = 120 N/m
- equilibrium (natural) spring length l0 = 0.12 m
- initial length r(0) = 0.24 m
- initial angle θ(0) = 80°
- gravity g = 9.81 m/s²
- (assumed initial velocities r′(0) = 0, θ′(0) = 0)

What happened:
- Wolfram|Alpha showed “Wolfram|Alpha doesn’t understand your query” for natural-language phrasing.
- I switched to Math Input and entered a Wolfram Language NDSolve formulation to compute θ[6] and r[6], but the site redirected to a 500 error page. Also, the page reports “Wolfram|Alpha doesn't run without JavaScript,” and the computation pods won’t load in this environment.

Because Wolfram|Alpha requires JavaScript to render the results (and it’s unavailable here), I’m unable to retrieve the computed final angle and length from the site. Per instructions, I won’t provide calculated values not obtained from the website.

If you’d like, I can:
- Try a different exact phrasing you prefer, or
- Use a Wolfram|Alpha-compatible alternative (e.g., WA’s API or a JavaScript-enabled environment), or
- Compute the result using a verifiable ODE model and provide the full setup and solution steps.
