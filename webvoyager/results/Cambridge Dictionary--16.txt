Here’s what I found on Cambridge Dictionary for “cryptocurrency.”

- Definition (Cambridge Dictionary):
  “a digital currency produced by a public network, rather than any government, that uses cryptography to make sure payments are sent and received safely: cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin”

- Pronunciation:
  • UK: /ˈkrɪp.təʊˌkʌr.ən.si/
  • US: /ˈkrɪp.toʊˌkɝː.ən.si/

Two example sentences (original):
1) The startup raised capital by issuing its own cryptocurrency to early supporters.
2) Some retailers now accept cryptocurrency for online purchases alongside traditional payment methods.
