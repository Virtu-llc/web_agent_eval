I completed the route planning on Google Maps and applied the “Less walking” preference for a transit route from Central Park Zoo to the Broadway Theatre in New York. Then I captured a screenshot of the final route results.

What I did:
- Opened Google Maps
- Clicked Directions
- Set starting point: Central Park Zoo, New York, NY 10021
- Set destination: Broadway Theatre, 1681 Broadway, New York, NY 10019
- Switched to Transit mode
- Opened Options and selected “Less walking”
- Closed Options to show filtered results and took a screenshot
