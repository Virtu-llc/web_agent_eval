I went to GitHub, navigated to GitHub Skills, opened the “Resolve merge conflicts” course, and captured the requested details.

Course: Resolve merge conflicts
Actions learners will perform (as listed on the course page):
1) Create a pull request
2) Resolve a merge conflict
3) Create a merge conflict
4) Merge your pull request
