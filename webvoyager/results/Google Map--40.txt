  "The worst seafood I have Ever ate in my life. Fish was not fresh moreover really didn’t smell bad. On my request waiter came and brought manager. They were very friendly and cooperative and offered choices. I ask for another dish and it was better at least not stinky butI cannot say it was good, fish was pretty plain, vegetables not tasty. My wife’s dish wasn’t cooked right at all, fish was overcooked, dry and not chew able."
