Task completed on Wolfram|Alpha.

What I did:
- Opened Wolfram|Alpha and ran the “time to sunburn” computation.
- Set location to Brazil.
- Set start time to 1:00 pm (local time).
- Used the “Compute” button to refresh results.
- Scrolled to show the “Typical time to sunburn” pod and took a screenshot.

Results shown on the page (interpreted by Wolfram|Alpha as “no sunscreen” = SPF 1):
- Skin type I: 16 min
- Skin type II: 21 min
- Skin type III: 32 min
- Skin type IV: 46 min
- Skin type V: 1 h 30 min
- Skin type VI: sunburn unlikely

Context from the page:
- Location: center of Brazil
- Start time: 1:00 pm UTC-03, Wednesday, September 17, 2025
- Sun protection advisory: exposure category very high; recommendation to apply SPF 15+ sunscreen, cover up, wear a hat and sunglasses, and minimize sun exposure between 10 am and 4 pm.
