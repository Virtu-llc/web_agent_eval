Task completed: I navigated to the Hugging Face site, opened the Transformers documentation, and located the section explaining how to add new tokens to a tokenizer. I captured a screenshot of the add_tokens section.

What the Transformers docs say about adding new tokens to a tokenizer:
- Method: add_tokens
  - “Add a list of new tokens to the tokenizer class. If the new tokens are not in the vocabulary, they are added to it with indices starting from length of the current vocabulary and will be isolated before the tokenization algorithm is applied. Added tokens and tokens from the vocabulary of the tokenization algorithm are therefore not treated in the same way.”
  - Important note: “When adding new tokens to the vocabulary, you should make sure to also resize the token embedding matrix of the model so that its embedding matrix matches the tokenizer. In order to do that, please use the resize_token_embeddings() method.”

- Method: add_special_tokens
  - “Add a dictionary of special tokens (eos, pad, cls, etc.) to the encoder and link them to class attributes. If special tokens are NOT in the vocabulary, they are added to it (indexed starting from the last index of the current vocabulary).”
  - Same resizing requirement: “When adding new tokens to the vocabulary, you should make sure to also resize the token embedding matrix of the model so that its embedding matrix matches the tokenizer. In order to do that, please use the resize_token_embeddings() method.”

Practical steps summarized from the docs:
1) Add standard tokens:
   - tokenizer.add_tokens(["<NEW_TOKEN_1>", "<NEW_TOKEN_2>", ...])
2) Add special tokens (optional):
   - tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token": "<PAD>", "eos_token": "<EOS>", ...})
3) Resize model embeddings so the model matches the updated tokenizer:
   - model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))

Screenshot:
- Saved a screenshot of the “add_tokens” section of the Transformers docs.
