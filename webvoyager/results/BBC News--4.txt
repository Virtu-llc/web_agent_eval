Here’s the most recent BBC article I found that directly addresses an economic effect of climate change in Europe, with extractable detail from the page:

Why it’s relevant to Europe’s economic implications of climate change
- The article details how European destinations—specifically Greece—are introducing climate-linked tourism fees to fund adaptation and resilience. This is a clear, current example of how climate change is altering economic policy and costs in Europe’s tourism economy.

Key points (focused on Europe and the economic angle)
- Greece’s climate fee replaces the overnight stay tax (introduced January 2024):
  - Travelers pay €0.50–€10 per night depending on hotel class/season, with surcharges up to €20 per person in peak periods on popular islands (e.g., Mykonos, Santorini).
  - Expected revenue: about €400m annually.
  - Intended use: water infrastructure, disaster prevention, and ecosystem restoration (i.e., climate adaptation).
- Economic mechanism:
  - Costs shift partly to visitors through modest surcharges that aggregate into substantial adaptation funding for destinations facing climate stressors (heat, drought, storms, fires).
  - This reframes tourism from pure consumption toward funding preservation/resilience—an economic restructuring in climate-exposed regions.
- Public acceptance and policy design:
  - Transparency is critical for legitimacy and willingness to pay (expert quotes emphasize the need for clear reporting).
  - Although the piece cites best-practice reporting examples (Maldives, New Zealand), the stated goal for Greece is similar: funding climate resilience and infrastructure.
- Broader trend:
  - These climate-linked fees are proliferating globally; in Europe, they directly raise destination revenues for adaptation while modestly increasing holiday costs for visitors.
  - Surveys indicate many travelers are willing to pay if the purpose and use are clear, supporting the economic viability of such measures.

Bottom line
- In Europe, climate change is prompting new economic instruments—like Greece’s Climate Crisis Resilience Fee—that increase visitor costs to fund adaptation infrastructure and environmental protection. This represents a material, ongoing shift in how European destinations finance climate resilience, especially in tourism-dependent regions.
