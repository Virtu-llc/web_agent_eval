- Proceeded to booking options page and captured a screenshot

Key findings (prices shown are “round trip total” for 2 adults in USD as displayed):
Nonstop options on Nov 1 (outbound) and Dec 8 (return):
- Etihad (operated by Wamos Air) from Zayed International (AUH) → FCO
  • Duration: 7 hr
  • Price: $1,141
- Etihad (AUH → FCO)
  • Duration: 6 hr 30 min
  • Price: $1,283
- ITA (DXB → FCO) [selected]
  • Duration: 7 hr
  • Price: $1,392
- Emirates (DXB → FCO)
  • Duration: 6 hr 40 min
  • Price: $1,768
- Emirates (DXB → FCO)
  • Duration: 6 hr 45 min
  • Price: $2,503

Selection rationale:
- Requirement: "select the option with the fewest stops." All listed above are nonstop (0 stops).
- Interpreting “from Dubai” as departing Dubai International Airport (DXB), the cheapest nonstop option from DXB is ITA at $1,392 total for 2 adults. This is the option I selected and opened to booking.

Selected itinerary details (as shown on the booking page):
- Airline: ITA
- Outbound: Sat, Nov 1 — DXB 1:50 AM → FCO 5:50 AM — Nonstop — 7 hr
- Return: Mon, Dec 8 — FCO 10:50 AM → DXB 7:50 PM — Nonstop — 6 hr
