Here’s what I did and found:

- Visited https://www.google.com/ and ran multiple targeted searches to identify a retired player named “James Smith” who retired in 2023 (“the year before last”) and then determine which club he was a member of from 2020–2021.
- I tried combinations such as:
  - James Smith retired 2023 footballer 2020 2021 club
  - "James Smith" retired 2023 footballer "2020-21" club
  - Site-specific searches (Wikipedia, Transfermarkt)
  - Variations across football, rugby, and cricket contexts

What appeared:
- Results frequently surfaced “Jimmy Smith (footballer, born 1987)” who retired in 2021 (not 2023).
- Other results were unrelated (college athlete rosters, general pages, or non-matching names).
- I did not find any credible result indicating a player named “James Smith” who retired in 2023 with a verifiable club membership for 2020–2021.

Conclusion:
- I could not locate a retired player named James Smith who retired in 2023, and therefore I cannot reliably determine which club he was a member of from 2020–2021 based on Google’s results.

Screenshot:
- I captured a screenshot of the final search results page showing the absence of relevant matches:

If you can share more details (sport, country, team, middle initial, or any known clubs), I can refine the search and try again.
