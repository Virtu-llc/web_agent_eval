I navigated to GitHub, opened the ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh repository, went to its Wiki, and opened the Themes page to the “agnoster” section.

How to change your zsh theme to “agnoster” (from the Oh My Zsh Wiki):
- Edit your ~/.zshrc and set the theme before sourcing Oh My Zsh:
  - Set ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
  - The page states: “In order to enable a theme, set ZSH_THEME to the name of the theme in your ~/.zshrc before sourcing Oh My Zsh; for example: ZSH_THEME=robbyrussell”
- Save the file and reload zsh:
  - Run: source ~/.zshrc

Agnoster-specific notes (from the agnoster section on the Themes page):
- Additional setup:
  - Install one of the patched fonts from Vim-Powerline or patch your own for the special characters.
  - Optional prompt cleanup:
    - Set DEFAULT_USER to your regular username to hide “user@hostname” locally.
    - Or add ALWAYS_SHOW_USER to your zshrc to always hide “user@hostname”.
