Here’s what I accomplished:

- Opened Booking.com
- Searched for Barcelona with dates Wed, Feb 25 — Sat, Feb 28, 2026 (3 nights, 2 adults)
- Sorted results by Distance from closest beach
- Applied filters to ensure:
  - Free WiFi
  - Breakfast included

What the page shows now:
- Results banner: “Barcelona: 352 properties found. Applied filters: Hotels, Breakfast included, Free Wifi. Sorted by: Distance from closest beach.”
- Top results (first 5) currently visible:
  1) Eurohotel Diagonal Port — Beachfront
  2) Hotel Arts Barcelona — Beachfront
  3) Sofitel Barcelona Skipper — Beachfront
  4) SLS Barcelona — 150 feet from beach
  5) Hotel Best Front Maritim — Beachfront
