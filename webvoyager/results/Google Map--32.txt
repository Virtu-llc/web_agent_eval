I completed the search on Google Maps with the following steps:
- Searched for “plumbers in Orlando, FL”
- Applied Hours filter: Open now
- Refined the query to exclude 24-hour businesses: “plumbers in Orlando, FL not "open 24 hours"”
- Re-applied Hours filter: Open now
- Ensured the results list was visible and took a screenshot

Note: Google Maps does not provide a direct filter to exclude “Open 24 hours” businesses, so while I applied “Open now” and added the negative condition in the search query, the results may still include some “Open 24 hours” listings.
