Task completed: I navigated the Cambridge Dictionary site to the English Grammar Today article “Present perfect simple (I have worked)” and extracted the uses plus sample affirmative, negative, and interrogative examples. I’ve also taken a screenshot of the “uses” section.

Present perfect simple: uses (from the Cambridge page)
- We use the present perfect simple to refer to events in the past that connect to the present.
- Experiences:
  - We use it to talk about experiences up to now; specific time isn’t important. Often with ever, never, before, in my life, so far, up until now.
- Recent completed events:
  - A finished event/state in the very recent past; often with just, recently; no specific time given.
- Past events, present results:
  - A single past action with a present connection/result.
- Time + for and since:
  - A present situation that began in the past and continues now; for periods (for three years), since points (since 2006).
- How long …?:
  - Use with for/since to ask about duration.
- Yet:
  - In questions and negatives for intended but not-yet-done actions.
- Already:
  - To emphasise something is done/achieved, often earlier than expected.
- Still:
  - To emphasise something expected to happen continues not to happen.
- Introducing past time events:
  - Often used in headlines/TV news to report recent events; followed by past simple for details.
- American English note:
  - AmE often uses past simple instead of present perfect, especially with already and yet (compare “Did you eat (yet)?” vs “Have you eaten (yet)?”).

Present perfect simple: form (from the table at the top of the page)
- Affirmative: have/has + past participle (e.g., “I/you/we/they have worked”, “He/she/it has worked”; short forms: I’ve, she’s)
- Negative: have/has not + past participle (e.g., “I/you/we/they have not worked”, “He/she/it has not worked”; short forms: haven’t, hasn’t)
- Interrogative: Have/Has + subject + past participle? (e.g., “Have I/you/we/they worked?”, “Has he/she/it worked?”)
- Negative interrogative: Have/Has + subject + not + past participle? or contracted Haven’t/Hasn’t + subject + past participle?

If you’d like, I can extract additional examples from specific subsections (e.g., “Yet”, “Already”, “Still”) or capture another screenshot showing the “form” table as well.
