Task completed: I visited Hugging Face, filtered Translation models by Most downloads, searched for en-ja, and identified the most downloaded English-to-Japanese (en-ja) model. I opened its model card and captured the evaluation metrics and a screenshot.

Most downloaded en-ja translation model
- Model: staka/fugumt-en-ja
- Downloads (listed in search results): 53.9k

Evaluation metrics stated on the model card
- Dataset/sample: Tatoeba (randomly selected 500 sentences)
- Metric: BLEU = 32.7
- Scoring details: sacrebleu with tokenization ja-mecab

Screenshot
- Saved file: test_cases/result_with_screenshot_small/Huggingface--9/screenshot_1758113174.png
- The screenshot displays the model card with the “Eval results” section showing the BLEU score and evaluation notes.
