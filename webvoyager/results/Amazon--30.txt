I navigated on Amazon, filtered to Books > Literature & Fiction results for “fiction 2024,” sorted by Avg. Customer Review, and evaluated top listings to ensure 2024 publication and at least 50 customer reviews. The first 5.0-star item had only 48 reviews (below the threshold), so I selected the next highest-rated qualifying title.

Highest-rated qualifying 2024 fiction book found:
- Title: A HOT BOY SUMMER WITH A QUEEN PIN BBW (TMP’S HOT BOY SUMMER 2024 Book 2)
- Author: O’SHARRA
- Format: Kindle Edition (book)
- Average rating: 4.8 out of 5 stars
- Number of customer reviews: 294
- Publication date: June 8, 2024
- Category/genre on page: Literature & Fiction (Urban Fiction)

Notes:
- The 5.0-star novel “YOU ARE THE JOURNEY: Discover 2024’s Most Inspiring Debut Novel” had only 48 reviews, so it did not meet the 50-review minimum.
- The selected title is sorted immediately after that and clearly meets the 2024 release and ≥50 reviews criteria.
