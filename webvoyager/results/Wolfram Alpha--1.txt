Actions taken:
- Visited https://www.wolframalpha.com/
- Searched for: “system of linear inequalities for the inner pentagon of a regular pentagram”
- Wolfram|Alpha interpreted the query as “regular pentagram” and displayed a “Defining inequalities” section.

Result (one constraint from the Defining inequalities for the pentagram’s inner region):
- 10 (sqrt(5 - 2 sqrt(5)) x + (sqrt(5) - 2) y) <= sqrt(650 - 290 sqrt(5)) a
- Variable constraint shown on the page: a > 0

Screenshot:
- Saved a screenshot of the result page with the “Defining inequalities” section visible.
