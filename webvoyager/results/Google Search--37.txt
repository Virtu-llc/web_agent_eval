Top 3 super-Earth planets (source: Space.com — “The 10 most Earth-like exoplanets”):
1) Gliese 667Cc
- Distance: ~22 light-years
- Size/Mass: At least 4.5× Earth’s mass
- Notes: Orbits a cooler red dwarf; completes an orbit in ~28 days and lies in the habitable zone, though it may be exposed to stellar flares.

2) Kepler-22b
- Distance: ~600 light-years
- Size: ~2.4× Earth’s radius
- Notes: First Kepler planet found in its star’s habitable zone; composition uncertain (rocky/liquid/gaseous); ~290-day orbit around a G-class star smaller and cooler than the Sun.

3) Kepler-69c
- Distance: ~2,700 light-years
- Size: ~1.7× Earth’s radius (about 70% larger than Earth)
- Notes: ~242-day orbit (similar position to Venus in our solar system); host star is ~80% as luminous as the Sun; appears to reside in the habitable zone.
