Here’s what I did and found:

- Opened arXiv.org
- Searched for “climate change modeling”
- Switched to Advanced Search to apply precise filters
- Applied filters:
  - Subject: Physics → archive: astro-ph
  - Added term: cat:astro-ph.EP
  - Date: Submission date, Date range from 2025-09-10 to 2025-09-17 (last 7 days from today)
- Submitted the advanced query

Result:
- The results page reports: “Sorry, your query returned no results”
- Therefore, the number of papers related to “climate change modeling” in Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) over the last week is 0.
