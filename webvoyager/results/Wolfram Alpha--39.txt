I used Wolfram|Alpha to compute the rotated equation and captured the result.

Result from Wolfram|Alpha (in variables X, Y after a 33° counterclockwise rotation):
- (X^2 + 3 Y^2) cos^2(33°) + 4 X Y cos(33°) sin(33°) + (3 X^2 + Y^2) sin^2(33°) = 4

Alternate exact form shown:
- X^2 (sin(2π/15) − 2) − 2 X Y cos(2π/15) + Y^2 (−2 − sin(2π/15)) = −4
