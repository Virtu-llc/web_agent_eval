Here’s what I found on Apple’s website:

- Number of Apple Pencil models currently available: 2
  - Apple Pencil Pro ($129)
  - Apple Pencil (USB‑C) ($79)

- Wireless pairing and charging:
  - Supported by: Apple Pencil Pro
  - Not supported by: Apple Pencil (USB‑C)

Evidence from Apple’s “Apple Pencil features” section shows “Wireless pairing and charging” is “Compatible with Apple Pencil Pro” and “Not compatible with Apple Pencil (USB‑C).”

Screenshot captured of the features section (showing the wireless pairing and charging row):
