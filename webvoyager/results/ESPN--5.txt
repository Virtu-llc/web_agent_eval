Here’s what I found on ESPN:

- Top scorer (latest completed NBA game): Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
- Points scored: 29
- Team: Oklahoma City Thunder
- Position: PG (Point Guard)

How I obtained it:
- Navigated to NBA Scores and selected the most recent completed game, which is the NBA Finals Game 7 (Pacers 91 at Thunder 103 on June 22, 2025). The game leaders on ESPN list S. Gilgeous-Alexander with 29 points.
- Opened the Thunder team roster on ESPN and verified Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s position as PG (Point Guard).
