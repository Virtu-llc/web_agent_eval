Result: 0

What I did:
- Went to arXiv Advanced Search and searched for “Chinese Benchmark” (All fields).
- Filtered by Date range with Announcement date set to From 2023-12 to 2023-12.
- The query returned “Sorry, your query returned no results,” so there are no papers announced in December 2023 for “Chinese Benchmark,” hence none that mention acceptance for AAAI 2024.
