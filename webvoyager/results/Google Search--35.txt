Task completed. Here are the results I found starting from Google and navigating to the latest Nature Astronomy research paper related to black holes, with a screenshot taken at the end.

Latest Nature Astronomy paper related to black holes
- Title: A complete measurement of a black-hole recoil through higher-order gravitational-wave modes
- Journal: Nature Astronomy
- Article type: Article (research)
- Published date: 09 September 2025
- Authors: Juan Calderón Bustillo; Samson H. W. Leong; Koustav Chandra
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-025-02632-5

- Abstract (excerpt): The study demonstrates how the presence of more than one gravitational-wave emission mode enables constraining the azimuthal orientation angle of a real GW event and, consequently, the kick direction of the remnant black hole. Analyzing GW190412 with a numerical relativity surrogate waveform model, the authors rule out kick magnitudes below the typical escape velocity of dense globular clusters (~50 km s−1) with a Bayes factor ~21 (~95% probability), and provide directional constraints on the recoil.
