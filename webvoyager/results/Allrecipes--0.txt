- Yield: 1 (9x13-inch) dish

Ingredients (original 1X yield; 8 servings)
- 2 cups peeled and diced pumpkin
- 1 eggplant, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds
- 5 tomatoes
- 1 pint ricotta cheese
- 9 ounces crumbled feta cheese
- 2/3 cup pesto
- 2 eggs, beaten
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce
- Fresh pasta sheets
- 1 1/3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions
1) Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Place pumpkin on a baking sheet and roast until browned and tender, about 30 minutes.
2) Meanwhile, grill eggplant on a charcoal grill or fry in a skillet, turning once, until charred and tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
3) Halve tomatoes and place on the baking sheet during the last 15 minutes of pumpkin roasting; cook until tender and wrinkly.
4) In a medium bowl, mix together ricotta, feta, pesto, eggs, salt, and pepper. Fold in the roasted pumpkin.
5) Spoon half of the tomato sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Lay two pasta sheets over the sauce. Arrange a single layer of eggplant slices over the pasta and top with half the ricotta mixture.
6) Cover with two more pasta sheets. Arrange the roasted tomatoes evenly over the sheets and spoon the remaining ricotta mixture over the tomatoes. Sprinkle with half the mozzarella.
7) Top with the remaining two sheets of pasta. Pour the remaining tomato sauce over all and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.
8) Bake 30 to 40 minutes, until golden and bubbly.
