Here’s what I did:
- Searched Amazon for wireless ergonomic keyboard backlit
- Applied filters: Features = Ergonomic, Backlit; Price = $45 to $90 (closest available preset to your $40–$60 range)
- Reviewed the resulting products for:
  - Wireless connectivity
  - Ergonomic design
  - Backlighting
  - Price between $40 and $60
  - Rating of at least 4 stars
  - 500+ customer reviews (ratings)

Findings:
- No product in the results meets all your conditions simultaneously (wireless + ergonomic + backlit + 4+ stars + $40–$60).
- Examples from the filtered results:
  - Nulea RT05 Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard (split, 7-color backlight): $69.99, 4.3 stars, 1,497 ratings — fails price ($69.99).
  - Adesso Tru-Form 150 3-Color Illuminated Ergonomic Keyboard: $44.99, 3.8 stars, 1,178 ratings — fails rating (3.8) and is wired (not wireless).
  - Perixx PERIBOARD-312 Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard: $59.99, 3.5 stars, 1,024 ratings — fails rating and is wired (not wireless).
  - Arteck Ergonomic USB Wired Backlit Keyboard: $49.99, 4.3 stars, 798 ratings — backlit and within price, but wired (not wireless).
  - Arteck Split Ergonomic (wireless): $57.99, 4.4 stars — within price and wireless, but not backlit.

Save action:
- Because no listing matched all criteria, there was no qualifying product to save.
- Additionally, saving to a list on Amazon requires signing in; without credentials, I cannot complete an “Add to List” action.

Screenshot:
- I’ve captured a screenshot of the filtered results showing the applied filters and representative listings.

If you’d like, I can:
- Relax one constraint (e.g., expand price to $60–$80 or accept wired) and then save the best match with 500+ reviews, or
- Keep all constraints and continue scanning additional pages, though based on page 1 results this combination looks unlikely in the $40–$60 range.
