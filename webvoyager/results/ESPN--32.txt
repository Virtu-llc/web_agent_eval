Here’s what I did:
- Navigated to ESPN > NHL > Scores (Scoreboard).
- Opened the calendar and selected yesterday’s date (Tuesday, September 16, 2025).
- Verified the page header and results shown for that date.

Findings for yesterday (Sep 16, 2025):
- The NHL scoreboard shows: “No games on this date.”
- Therefore, there are no team performances or results to report for yesterday on ESPN.
