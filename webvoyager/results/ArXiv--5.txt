Here are the totals I found on arXiv for the query "quantum computing":

- Quantum Physics category (quant-ph): 30,461 results
- All archives: 50,182 results

I performed the search on arXiv, applied the Quantum Physics subject filter via Advanced Search, captured the total results shown, then repeated the search across all archives.

Screenshot of the final (all archives) results page has been taken: test_cases/result_with_screenshot_small/ArXiv--5/screenshot_1758020838.png
