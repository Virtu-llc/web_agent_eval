Here’s what I did and what I found:

Actions taken
- Visited https://www.bbc.com/news/
- Used the site’s menu search and the page search bar with multiple query variations:
  - “What is climate change? A really simple guide”
  - With quotes: “What is climate change? A really simple guide”
  - “BBC News climate change a really simple guide”
  - “A really simple guide BBC climate change”
  - “What is climate change?”
- Tried selecting typeahead suggestions from the side menu search (using keyboard navigation), and paginating/search refinements.
- Also checked primary navigation areas (BBC InDepth, Earth) to see if the explainer surfaced there.

Result
- Despite multiple searches and variations, the BBC site search did not surface the specific article “What is climate change? A really simple guide” in the results I could access. Because of this, I could not open that exact article to extract the requested information.
- Per your request to take a screenshot at the final step, I captured the current search results page.

Note
- I’m not able to infer or supply the answer about “what human activities are causing climate change” without opening and citing the exact BBC article you specified. If you can share a direct link to that article (or a BBC topic page that lists it), I can immediately open it, extract the relevant section, and provide the answer verbatim.
