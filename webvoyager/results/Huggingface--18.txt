Here’s what I accomplished:
- Navigated to huggingface.co
- Opened the Docs section and selected TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)
- Used the docs search to find “Adding a margin to the loss”
- Opened the page: Reward Modeling > Using the RewardTrainer > Adding a margin to the loss

What the documentation says about adding a margin to the loss:
- You can add a margin to the reward loss by adding a margin column to your dataset (as used in the Llama 2 paper).
- The reward data collator will automatically pass the margin through and compute the loss accordingly.
- Example snippet on the page shows how to compute and add the margin to the dataset:
  - Define a function add_margin(row) that returns {'margin': row['score_chosen'] - row['score_rejected']}
  - Apply it with dataset = dataset.map(add_margin)

Screenshot:
- Saved a screenshot of the “Adding a margin to the loss” section with the explanatory text and code example.
