Ingredients (as listed on the page)
- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 teaspoons salt (for seasoning chicken)
- 1/2 cup cooking oil
- 1 1/2 cups chopped onion
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon water (for spice mixture)
- 1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 teaspoon salt (for sauce)
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro (additional)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Cooking instructions (summarized from the page)
1) Season chicken: Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.
2) Brown chicken: Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Brown the chicken in batches on all sides, then transfer to a plate.
3) Sauté aromatics: Reduce heat to medium. In the remaining oil, cook onion, garlic, and ginger until the onion is soft and translucent (5–8 minutes).
4) Toast spices: Stir in curry powder, ground cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon water. Cook about 1 minute, stirring.
5) Build the sauce: Add crushed tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt; stir to combine.
6) Return chicken and simmer: Return the chicken (and any juices) to the skillet. Add 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat. Sprinkle in garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro.
7) Cook through: Cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through (about 20 minutes). An instant-read thermometer should read at least 165°F (74°C).
8) Finish: Drizzle with fresh lemon juice to serve.
