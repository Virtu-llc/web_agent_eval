Outcome:
Yes — on Apple’s website, the Mac mini can be configured with a GPU larger than 16‑core. On the Mac mini configuration page for the M4 Pro model, the “Chip (Processor)” options include:
- Apple M4 Pro chip with 12‑core CPU, 16‑core GPU (base)
- Apple M4 Pro chip with 14‑core CPU, 20‑core GPU (+$200)

This confirms a 20‑core GPU option is available.

Screenshot:
I captured a screenshot showing the chip options with the 20‑core GPU visible.
