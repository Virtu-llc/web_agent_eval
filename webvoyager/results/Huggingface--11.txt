What I did
- Visited https://huggingface.co
- Navigated to Models > filtered by task “Image-to-Video”
- Sorted results by “Recently updated”
- Opened the most recently updated model’s page
- Extracted key information from the model card
- Took a screenshot of the final page

Latest updated Image-to-Video model
- Name: Phr00t/WAN2.2-14B-Rapid-AllInOne
- Updated: about 6 hours ago
- Stars: 670
- Base model: Wan-AI/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B (14B)

Main features (from the model card)
- All-in-one merge for speed and simplicity:
  - Mixtures of WAN 2.2 and other WAN-like models and accelerators
  - Includes CLIP and VAE in the checkpoint
  - FP8 precision for faster generation
- Supported generation modes:
  - Image-to-Video (I2V)
  - Text-to-Video (T2V)
  - First frame → last frame and last frame only (via VACE)
  - The “MEGA Merge” variant is a “one model to rule them all,” covering I2V, T2V, and VACE flows with a provided workflow (mega-v1/)
- Usage and recommendations:
  - Designed to be easy and fast (“all in one”); intended to use 1 CFG and 4 steps
  - Recommended samplers:
    - For MEGA v1: ipndm/sgm_uniform sampler/scheduler
    - Earlier versions recommend euler_a/beta or sa_solver depending on version
  - WAN 2.1 LoRA compatibility is generally good; “low noise” WAN 2.2 LoRAs also compatible (avoid “high noise” LoRAs). Adjust LoRA strengths as needed
- Iterative improvements (changelog highlights):
  - Progressive fixes to I2V noise and scene shifting
  - Integration of WAN 2.2 Lightning and other accelerators (e.g., SkyReels, Fun, FunReward)
  - MEGA v1 eliminates previous I2V noise issues while unifying I2V/T2V workflows
- Notes:
  - NSFW merge variants exist (user discretion advised)
  - Trade-off acknowledged: prioritizes speed/simplicity over the higher per-frame quality of full WAN 2.2 pipelines
  - GGUF and FP16 variants are linked from the card (external/community builds)
