I checked ESPN’s NBA scoreboard for yesterday’s date.

Findings:
- Date selected: Tuesday, September 16, 2025 (yesterday)
- ESPN shows: “No games on this date.”
- Therefore, there were no NBA games played yesterday and no final scores to report.

Screenshot:
- Saved a screenshot of the ESPN NBA scoreboard page showing the “No games on this date” message.
