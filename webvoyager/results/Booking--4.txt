Notes:
- The search results were specifically for the Kashi Vishwanath Temple landmark in Varanasi, ensuring proximity. If you want the absolute cheapest within a tighter distance (e.g., less than 0.5 miles), I can apply the “Less than 1/2 mile” distance filter and report the cheapest option under that constraint.
