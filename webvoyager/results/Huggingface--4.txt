Task completed: Located an open-source conversational AI model on Hugging Face that is trained in English, extracted its key details, features, and applications. I attempted to take a screenshot of the final page but encountered a persistent page screenshot timeout (details below).

Model found
- Name: tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct
- URL: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct
- License: Apache-2.0 (open-source)
- Languages: English and French; model card notes it is mostly trained on English data
- Tags on page: conversational, English, text-generation, transformers, PyTorch, Safetensors

Main features (from the model card)
- Model type and size: 7B-parameter causal decoder-only model, finetuned on chat/instruct data (based on Falcon-7B)
- Training focus: Finetuned on a 250M-token mixture of instruct/chat datasets:
  - Baize (chat): 65% (~164M tokens)
  - GPT4All (instruct): 25% (~62M tokens)
  - GPTeacher (instruct): 5% (~11M tokens)
  - RefinedWeb-English: 5% (~13M tokens)
- Language(s): English and French; explicitly “mostly trained on English data”
- Architecture optimizations:
  - FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022)
  - Multi-query attention (Shazeer et al., 2019)
  - Rotary positional embeddings (Su et al., 2021)
  - Parallel attention/MLP with a single layer norm
- Key specs:
  - Vocabulary size: 65,024
  - Sequence length: 2,048
  - Tensor type: BF16
- Usage notes:
  - Ready-to-use chat/instruct model
  - Requires PyTorch 2.0 for use with transformers
  - Example inference provided; suggests at least 16 GB memory for smooth inference
- License and openness: Available under Apache 2.0 license (open-source)

Applications (from the page’s “Why use” and “Uses/Direct Use” sections)
- Direct use: A ready-to-use chat/instruct model for conversational AI and instruction-following interactions
  - Chatbots and assistant-style dialogue
  - Instruction following in conversational settings
- Noted limitations and out-of-scope:
  - Mostly trained on English; may not generalize well to other languages
  - Production use should include guardrails and risk mitigation
  - Out-of-scope: deploying without adequate assessment of risks and mitigations

Screenshot status
- I attempted to capture a screenshot of the model page multiple times, but the browser reported a timeout when taking the page screenshot:
  - Error: Page.screenshot: Timeout 30000ms exceeded. Call log: taking page screenshot; waiting for fonts to load... fonts loaded
- I tried reloading the page, waiting for content to stabilize, and scrolling before retrying; the same timeout persisted.

If you’d like, I can retry the screenshot or capture a narrower region once the page allows it.
