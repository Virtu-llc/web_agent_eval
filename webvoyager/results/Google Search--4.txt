Here’s what I did and found:

1) Navigated to Google, searched for “Steam & Game Stats,” and opened the official Steam stats pages. From the Steam Stats and Steam Charts pages, I extracted the current “Most Played” data and the live in-game figure.

Most Played games on Steam (by current players, now)
- Counter-Strike 2 — 588,706 current players
- Dota 2 — 399,243 current players
