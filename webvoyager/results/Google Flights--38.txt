Task completed: I searched Google Flights for economy class, one-way flights from Oslo (OSL) to Dubai (DXB area), departing on Sunday, March 8, 2026, and applied the “Stops: 2 stops or fewer” filter. Below are the options visible on the results page with their prices, durations, and stops.

Top flights

- Norwegian — $194 — 7 hr 5 min — Nonstop (arrives Dubai Al Maktoum DWC)
- Emirates — $572 — 6 hr 55 min — Nonstop (arrives Dubai International DXB)

Notes
- All prices are shown in USD as displayed by Google Flights for 1 adult, taxes/fees included (carry-on/checked bag fees may be extra).
- “Dubai” includes nearby airports; some options arrive at DWC or SHJ rather than DXB.
- The stops filter is set to “2 stops or fewer,” so all options listed have 0–2 layovers.
