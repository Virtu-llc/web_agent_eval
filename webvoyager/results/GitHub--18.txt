What I did:
- Opened GitHub and searched for “topic:image-processing sort:stars” to list repositories tagged with image-processing, sorted by stars.
- Confirmed the top-ranked repository by star count on the results page.
- Captured a screenshot of the results.

Result:
- Most popular image processing tool: opencv/opencv
- Description: Open Source Computer Vision Library
- Stars: 84,012 (as shown on the search results page at the time of access)
