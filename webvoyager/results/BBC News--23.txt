Main findings and recommendations:
- Be kind to yourself
  - Brain fog is common and usually temporary. Slow down, delegate, and ask for help if needed. Contact your GP if you’re concerned.
- Create routines
  - Reduce decision fatigue with predictable morning and evening routines. Prep simple things (clothes, breakfast) to free mental bandwidth.
- Take breaks
  - Avoid back‑to‑back commitments. Insert 5–10 minute “mental buffers” between tasks to reset, reduce stress, and improve focus.
- Use calendars and reminders
  - Offload memory to tools. Use calendars, recurring reminders, and blocked time (e.g., lunch) to prevent cognitive overload.

Dr. Tharaka’s SWANS acronym for brain health:
- Sleep: Aim for 7–9 hours nightly to rest and consolidate memory.
- Water: Stay hydrated; even mild dehydration can impair focus.
- Activity: Move regularly (walks, light jogs, stretching) to boost blood flow and clarity.
- Nutrition: Favor whole foods; include choline-rich options (eggs, fish, nuts) for concentration.
- Stress: Lower cortisol with breathing exercises, mindfulness, and hobbies.
