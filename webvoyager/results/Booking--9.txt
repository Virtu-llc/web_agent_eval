Here’s what I found on Booking.com for 2 adults in London, for 4 nights from Thu, Dec 25 to Mon, Dec 29 (currency: USD). I selected options under $250 per night (i.e., total under $1,000 for 4 nights). Dates and guests are set on the site.

At least 3 suitable options:
1) Holiday Inn Express London – ExCel by IHG
- Total for 4 nights: $494
- Area: Newham, London
- Room example shown: Standard Room with Free Hot Breakfast
- Distance: 7.4 miles from downtown

2) Holiday Inn Express Royal Docks by IHG

3) Hilton London Wembley

4) ibis London Blackfriars

Note: All prices above are shown on Booking.com search results for the specified dates and include the selection for 2 adults. They meet the “under $250 per night” criterion by having totals under $1,000 for the 4-night stay.
