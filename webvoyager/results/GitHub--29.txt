Task completed: I visited GitHub’s Pricing page and checked the “Compare features” table for the “Private repositories” row.

Findings (from https://github.com/pricing):
- Free plan: Unlimited private repositories
- Pro plan: Not explicitly listed on this page. The paid plan shown (“Team”) also lists Unlimited private repositories under the same “Private repositories” row.

Screenshot: I took a screenshot of the Pricing comparison section showing the “Private repositories” row.
