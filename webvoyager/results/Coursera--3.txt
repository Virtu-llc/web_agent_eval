Here’s what I did:
- Visited Coursera and searched for “Python Data Science”
- Sorted the results by “Newest”
- Identified the first result and its institution
- Captured a screenshot at the final step

Result:
- First course (sorted by Newest): Practical Splunk for Beginners
- Institution: Pearson
