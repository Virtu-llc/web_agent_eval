Here’s what I found for “gestalt” on the Cambridge Dictionary:

- Meaning: something such as a structure or experience that, when considered as a whole, has qualities that are more than the total of all its parts.
- Pronunciation:
  - UK: /ɡəˈʃtælt/
  - US: /ɡəˈʃtɑːlt/
- Example sentence: This new biography is the first to consider fully the writer's gestalt.
