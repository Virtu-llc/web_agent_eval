Task completed:
- Navigated to arXiv.org
- Opened arXiv Help
- Visited the “Withdrawals” help page and focused on the section “Submission not yet announced” (how to withdraw before announcement)
- Took a screenshot at the final step

Key guidance from the page (Submission not yet announced):
- If your submission is not yet publicly available, you can delete or delay it from your user page:
  - Go to your user page and select either:
    - Delete (trash icon) to remove the submission from the system, or
    - Unsubmit (unsubmit icon) to return it to incomplete status for later modification and resubmission.
- If you have difficulty, contact arXiv administrators immediately with your submission identifier, a description of the problem, and the reason for withdrawal.
