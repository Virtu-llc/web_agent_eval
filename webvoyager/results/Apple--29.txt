Task completed.

What I found on Apple’s site:
- Latest MacBook Air (M4), 13‑inch: Up to 15 hours wireless web
- Latest MacBook Air (M4), 15‑inch: Up to 15 hours wireless web

Source path followed: Apple > Mac > Compare Models, then scrolled to the “Power and Battery” row which shows the web browsing battery life for both latest MacBook Air models.
