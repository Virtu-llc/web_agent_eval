Here’s what I did:
- Opened Google Flights and set the route to New York → London
- Set round-trip dates to departing January 10, 2026 and returning January 17, 2026
- Loaded the results and identified the cheapest available round-trip fare
- Captured a screenshot at the final results view

Lowest round‑trip fare found:
- Price: $410 (round trip total)
- Airlines: Iberia + Vueling (operated by Iberia for LEVEL)
- Stops: 1 stop (long overnight layover in Barcelona on outbound)
- Outbound example shown: JFK 11:45 PM Sat Jan 10 → LHR 9:10 AM Mon Jan 12 (total outbound duration 28 hr 25 min; includes ~18 hr 10 min overnight layover in Barcelona)
- Note: Return details appear after selecting the itinerary; Google lists these as “Other departing flights” with round‑trip totals for the complete itinerary.

Other notable cheaper options:
- $439 — 1 stop (Iberia + Vueling), JFK 11:45 PM Sat Jan 10 → LGW 7:25 PM Sun Jan 11 (total outbound 14 hr 40 min; layover in Barcelona)
- $476 — 1 stop (TAP Air Portugal), EWR 5:40 PM Sat Jan 10 → LGW 9:50 AM Sun Jan 11 (layover in Lisbon; total outbound 11 hr 10 min)
- Cheapest nonstop options: $487 — Nonstop
  - American (JFK 9:50 PM Sat Jan 10 → LHR 9:40 AM Sun Jan 11; 6 hr 50 min)
  - British Airways (multiple JFK departures around 6:50–11:20 PM; ~6 hr 55 min)
  - United (EWR several departures; ~7 hr 10–25 min) from $499

- Price context shown on page: “Cheapest from $410” (tab header), with “Top departing flights” showing best mixes of price + convenience (mostly nonstop from $487), and “Other departing flights” listing the absolute cheapest, including 1-stop with long layovers.

If you want, I can sort the results by “Cheapest” and capture another screenshot, or expand a specific itinerary for full outbound/return details.
