Here’s what I found on Hugging Face.

Most downloaded en→zh translation model
- Model: Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-zh
- Why this one: Among translation models filtered for English and Chinese and sorted by Most downloads, this is the top English→Chinese (en-zh) model. Higher-download Chinese→English (zh-en) models exist, but this model is the top specifically for the en→zh direction.

Latest performance metrics (from the model card)
- Test set: Tatoeba-test.eng.zho
- BLEU: 31.4
- chrF2: 0.268
- Additional stats shown: brevity_penalty 0.896, ref_len 110,468
- Train date noted in card: 2020-07-17

Usage guidelines (from the model card)
- Task: text2text-generation (Marian-based Transformer)
- Preprocessing: normalization + SentencePiece (spm32k, spm32k)
- Required language token: A sentence-initial target language token must be added in the form >>id<< (id = valid target language ID). The card lists supported Chinese targets including: zho, zho_Hans, zho_Hant, cmn, cmn_Hans, cmn_Hant, yue, wuu, gan, lzh, and variants. For simplified Chinese, use e.g. >>zho_Hans<<; for generic Chinese use >>zho<<.
- Source language(s): eng
- Target language(s): Chinese variants as above
- License: apache-2.0
- Libraries: Transformers (supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Rust)
- Inference: Available via HF Inference API; code snippets are provided on the model page (Use this model / View Code Snippets)

Example usage (typical pattern)
- With Transformers pipeline (Python), prepend the target token to your input text before passing it to the model:
  - from transformers import pipeline
  - translator = pipeline("translation", model="Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-zh")
  - result = translator(">>zho_Hans<< Your English text here.")
- Ensure the target token matches your desired Chinese variant, e.g., >>zho_Hans<< (Simplified), >>zho_Hant<< (Traditional), >>cmn<< (Mandarin), etc.
