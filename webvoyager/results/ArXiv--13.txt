Here’s what I did and found:

- Visited https://arxiv.org/
- Opened Advanced Search
- Set Field to search = Title and entered the term: SimCSE
- Submitted the advanced search

Result:
- The page displays: “Showing 1–5 of 5 results”
- Therefore, the number of articles on arXiv with “SimCSE” in the title is 5.
