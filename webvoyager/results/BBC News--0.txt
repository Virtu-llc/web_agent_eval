- Summary: The report covers Swaffham Prior in Cambridgeshire, the first UK rural village to develop a heat network. It explains how the council-owned system uses boreholes supplying ground-source heat pumps (with air-source support) to deliver low-carbon heat to homes through a pipe network. About 100 homes are connected so far, with total project costs at £14m. The piece discusses costs, scalability, community uptake, funding (including government grants and council investment), and lessons for future UK villages adopting similar low-carbon heating infrastructure.
