Here’s what I found on Google:

Most recent Nobel Prize in Physics (2024)
- Laureates: John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton
- Contribution: “Foundational discoveries and inventions that enabled machine learning with artificial neural networks.” 
  - John J. Hopfield: Created the Hopfield network (1982), enabling storage and reconstruction of information from incomplete or distorted inputs.
  - Geoffrey Hinton: Developed methods (including the Boltzmann machine) that allow neural networks to learn from data, underpinning modern AI.

This information appears in Google’s result summary referencing NobelPrize.org.
