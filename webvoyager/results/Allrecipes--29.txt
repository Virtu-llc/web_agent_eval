Ingredients (as listed on the page)
- 1 (8 ounce) swordfish steak (about 2 inches thick)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 cups fresh spinach, rinsed, dried, and torn into bite-size pieces
- 1/4 cup crumbled feta

Cooking method (grilling directions from the page)
1) Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2) Cut a slit in the swordfish steak to create a pocket open on one side only.
3) Mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and lemon juice; brush over both sides of the fish and set aside.
4) Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook the spinach until wilted.
5) Stuff the spinach into the fish pocket, then place the feta in the pocket over the spinach.
6) Grill the fish 8 minutes, turn, and continue cooking until done (an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part should read 145°F/63°C).
