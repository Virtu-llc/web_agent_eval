Task completed on ESPN.

What I did:
- Navigated to ESPN > NBA > Los Angeles Lakers > Stats.
- Confirmed the season filter is set to “2024-25 Regular Season.”
- Read the Player Stats table to get Anthony Davis’ Games Played (GP) and the team’s total games.

Findings from the page:
- Team total games (Total row, GP): 82
- Anthony Davis GP: 42

Calculation:
- Anthony Davis GP% = 42 / 82 = 51.22% (approximately 51.2%)

Players with the same GP% as Anthony Davis:
- I scanned the GP column for all listed Lakers players on the 2024-25 Regular Season stats page. No other player has 42 GP. Therefore, no other player has the same GP percentage as Anthony Davis.

Screenshot:
- Saved a screenshot of the final view.
