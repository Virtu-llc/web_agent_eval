Here’s what I did and the result from Wolfram|Alpha:

- Opened Wolfram|Alpha and computed the basal metabolic rate and energy expenditure for:
  - Male, 40 years, 175 cm, 90 kg
  - Wolfram|Alpha returned:
    - Basal metabolic rate: 1855 Cal/day
    - Energy expenditure (sedentary): 2226 Cal/day

- Using a daily intake of 1500 Cal, this implies a daily deficit of 2226 − 1500 = 726 Cal/day (sedentary assumption from Wolfram|Alpha).

- Then I asked Wolfram|Alpha to compute:
  ((17 kg) × (7700 Cal/kg)) / (2226 Cal/day − 1500 Cal/day)

Result from Wolfram|Alpha:
- 180.3 days
- Also shown as 180 days 7 hours 16 minutes 21.82 seconds
- ≈ 25.76 weeks

Notes:
- The calculation uses Wolfram|Alpha’s sedentary energy expenditure for the given demographics and the standard energy equivalence of 7700 dietary Calories per kilogram of body fat, exactly as shown in Wolfram|Alpha’s input interpretation. Actual weight loss may vary with activity level and individual factors.
