Actions taken:
- Opened https://www.wolframalpha.com/
- Entered the query: solve g'(x) + cos(g(x)) = 0, g(0) = 1
- Retrieved the Result and captured a screenshot

Result (as shown by Wolfram|Alpha):
g(x) = 2 cos^(-1)((sinh(x) (cos(1/2) - sin(1/2)) + cosh(x) (cos(1/2) - sin(1/2)) + sin(1/2) + cos(1/2)) / (sqrt(2) sqrt(-(sin(1) - 1) sinh(2 x) - ((sin(1) - 1) cosh(2 x)) + 1 + sin(1))))

Notes:
- The result is already a particular solution satisfying g(0) = 1; no arbitrary constant appears in the final expression.
