Here’s a large store in Washington that I located on Google Maps, with kids’ and parking details verified from the listing. I also checked for maternity but could not confirm that attribute from the Google Maps page content.

Store
- Name: Nordstrom
- Address: 100 Bellevue Square, Bellevue, WA 98004

Kids’ products
- Verified via reviews on the listing. Example review excerpt shown in the Reviews tab: “Had a pleasant visit at Nordstrom in Bellevue Square Mall while browsing kids’ wear and shoes. The elevator made it easy to get to the third-floor kids section...”

Maternity products
- I searched “maternity” in the store’s Google Maps Reviews (using the “Search reviews” feature) and saw “No reviews mention ‘maternity’.”
- The “About” tab (Offerings) lists “Men’s clothing” and “Women’s clothing” but does not explicitly list “Maternity clothing.”
- Result: Not confirmed on the Google Maps listing.

Parking
- Confirmed on the “About” tab:
  - Accessibility: “Wheelchair accessible parking lot”
  - Parking: “On-site parking”

Screenshot
- I’ve captured a screenshot of the store’s “About” tab showing the Parking information.

Note
- If you need a store where the Google Maps listing explicitly shows “Maternity clothing” in Offerings, I can keep searching for a different large chain location (e.g., certain Target, Walmart, Old Navy, or H&M stores) whose About tab or attributes include “Maternity clothing.”
