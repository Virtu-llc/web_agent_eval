Task completed on ESPN.

What I did:
- Opened espn.com
- Used the site’s search to query: Golden
- Opened the Teams tab in ESPN Search results
- Counted the number of teams listed with “Golden” in their name, and identified how many are in the NHL

Results found on ESPN:
- Total teams with "Golden" in their name (Teams tab): 31
- Number of those teams in the NHL: 1 (Vegas Golden Knights)
