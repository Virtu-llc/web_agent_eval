- ArXiv ID: arXiv:2509.13027
- Category: nlin.CD (Chaotic Dynamics)

Abstract summary
- Problem: Detecting chaotic dynamics in short, noisy experimental time series—particularly in cardiac systems—often defeats standard chaos-detection methods, and deep learning typically needs more data than such experiments provide.
- Approach: The authors introduce an automatic algorithm that integrates deep learning with targeted selection strategies based on a mathematical model tailored to the nature of the experimental data. This hybrid strategy avoids the need for conventional training on large datasets.
- Data/Testbed: Ex-vivo frog heart signal recordings.
- Outcome: The method achieves highly accurate detection/analysis of chaotic dynamics in these biological time series, showing promise for robust chaos analysis under real-world data constraints.
