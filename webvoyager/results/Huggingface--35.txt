- Latest Diffusion-tagged blog found: “Fast LoRA inference for Flux with Diffusers and PEFT” (Published July 23, 2025) — URL: https://huggingface.co/blog/lora-fast

Intro/overview summary:
- The post focuses on speeding up LoRA-based inference for text-to-image models, using Flux.1-Dev as the main example due to its popularity and large ecosystem of LoRA adapters (30k+).
- It explains why LoRA adapters matter: they enable style/character customization and can reduce latency, but practical serving often involves hotswapping adapters with differing ranks/target layers, which can trigger costly recompilation.
- The authors present an optimization “recipe” that aims for realistic, production-friendly speedups without recompilation hiccups: Flash Attention 3 (FA3), torch.compile, FP8 quantization via TorchAO, and a hotswap-ready setup in Diffusers. Although demonstrated on Flux, the approach is intended to generalize to other models.
- They note FP8 is lossy but often yields the best speed-memory trade-off, and while they tested primarily on NVIDIA GPUs, it should also work on AMD.
