Task completed: I visited Cambridge Dictionary, used the Grammar search, found the “Less or fewer?” page in the English Grammar Today section, extracted the key differences and examples, and took a screenshot.

- URL: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/less-or-fewer?q=fewer+and+less

Key differences (from Cambridge Dictionary)
- Core rule:
  - less: used with uncountable nouns
  - fewer: used with plural countable nouns
- With “of” before determiners/pronouns:
  - less of + singular noun
  - fewer of + plural noun
- Without a noun (ellipsis): You can omit the noun when it’s obvious from context.
- Usage note: You will often hear “less” with plural countable nouns in informal speech, but traditionally this is not considered correct (use “fewer” instead).

Examples from Cambridge Dictionary
- Less with uncountable nouns:
  - “I do less work at weekends than I used to.”
- Fewer with plural nouns:
  - “Better cycle routes would mean fewer cars and fewer accidents.”
- Usage warning (traditional preference noted):
  - “We’ve got less pizzas than we need. There’s ten people and only eight pizzas.” (traditionally correct usage: “fewer pizzas”)
- Less/fewer with “of”:
  - “It was funny to begin with, but as time went on, it became less of a joke.” (less of + singular)
  - “Fewer of them will be getting that information from newspapers which arrive hours after the news has occurred.” (fewer of + plural)
- Without a noun (ellipsis):
  - “Every year in Britain about 5,000 people die on the roads. Fewer are killed at work.” (fewer people)
