I completed your request on Google Flights.

What I did:
- Set a round-trip search from Stockholm to Toronto
- Set dates: Depart Tue, Mar 3, 2026 and Return Tue, Mar 10, 2026
- Sorted the results by Duration (shortest total travel time first)

Top result after sorting by Duration (outbound list):
- Icelandair — 11 hr 30 min total duration — 1 stop (1 hr 45 min in KEF) — From $419 round trip total (as shown)

Screenshot:
- Saved a screenshot of the results page sorted by Duration.
