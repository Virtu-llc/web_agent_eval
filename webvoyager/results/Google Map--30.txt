User comments (direct excerpts from the Reviews tab):
- “It has a convenient location but most of the spaces are either occupied quickly or in areas where they are not maximizing their full parking potential. With it also doubling as a Car Rental space maybe the reason why the spots are not as …”
- “I can’t say enough about this hotel. Every single person has been friendly and accommodating. If your platinum and about members the M lounge is fantastic. Great location to downtown Brooklyn and Dumbo. Rooms are clean and spacious for NY standard. Could it be updated a bit? Sure, but the hospitality here wins the 5 stars.”
- “I recently stayed at this hotel in downtown Brooklyn, and I have to say, it’s in a fantastic location! Just a short walk from the subway, making it super easy to get to and from Manhattan. This hotel is a great alternative to pricier …”

- “I had a terrible experience staying here. The staff was very unhelpful and unwelcoming. The water from the tap was yellow and stinky so when I went to rinse my mouth at night I was disgusted to taste this water. …”
- “Don't do it!!! When I got off the elevator that man was pulling up with my car to give to someone else!!! When I asked him how is that possible he said he knows out ticket numbers. Lame excuse!! And lame prices too! You best park on the street.”
- “This is a good place to park however we pre-paid and had reservations and were told there was no parking left and only because we refused to leave did they give us a spot. But it was literally the only spot left and it wasn’t even a spot. They parked me in the middle of the garage. Beware.”

Note: Many reviews reference the connected hotel experience; a couple specifically describe parking garage operational issues (e.g., handing a car to someone else; oversold/pre-paid issues).
