Here’s what I did and what I found:

Steps completed
- Opened Amazon.com and searched for “black stroller.”
- Applied filters:
  - Price range set to around $100–$200 (custom price slider was active with a reset option shown; items displayed were $101.99 to $199.99).
  - Customer Reviews: 4 Stars & Up.
  - Sorted by: Avg. Customer Review.
- Browsed across multiple result pages and tried alternative brand and query refinements (e.g., Baby Trend, Summer 3Dlite, Expedition jogger variants) while keeping the goal in mind.

Findings
- Among the filtered “black strollers” in the $100–$200 range, I did not find any item with over 20,000 reviews and a rating greater than 4 stars.
- Examples from the filtered results set:
  - Summer Infant 3Dlite+ Convenience Stroller (Black): ~$131.52, 4.6 stars, 3,760 ratings.
  - Baby Trend Snap-N-Go Double Stroller: ~$101.99, 4.6 stars, 9,053 ratings.
  - Mompush Wiz 2-in-1 Baby Stroller: ~$169.99, 4.6 stars, 3,022 ratings.
- Items with over 20,000 reviews I encountered (e.g., Ingenuity 3D Mini Convenience Stroller, 21,958 ratings) were priced below $100 and therefore outside your $100–$200 price constraint.

Screenshot
- I captured a screenshot of the filtered search results page (black strollers, ~$100–$200, 4 Stars & Up, sorted by Avg. Customer Review) showing representative items and the active filters:

Conclusion
- Based on the current Amazon listings and the applied filters, there were no black strollers priced between $100 and $200 that have more than 20,000 reviews and a rating over 4 stars. I’ve provided a screenshot of the filtered results as evidence. If you’d like, I can broaden the query (e.g., include non-“black” color variants or allow $90–$200) to try to surface a match.
