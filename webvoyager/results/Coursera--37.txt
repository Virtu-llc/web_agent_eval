Here’s what I accomplished:
- Opened the Coursera homepage
- Navigated via the homepage footer link to “Free Courses”
- Applied the “Free” cost filter (confirmed by “1 active filter” and “Clear Free filter” indicator)
- Extracted the titles of free courses currently shown

At least three free courses (from the filtered results):
