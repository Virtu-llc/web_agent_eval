Task completed on Amazon:
- Searched for “portable air conditioner 300 sq ft”
- Applied Floor Area filter: “299 to 399 ft²” (suitable for a 300 sq ft room)
- Collected prices of the top three visible product results
- Took a screenshot of the results section

Top 3 results and prices (as shown):

Notes:
- All three results are suitable for a 300 sq ft room (first explicitly states 300 sq ft; the other two are rated up to 350 sq ft).
- The search results page does not show an explicit energy efficiency rating (e.g., EER/SEER). This information typically appears on the individual product pages. The left-hand filters did not include a specific “Energy Efficiency” filter for portable ACs on this results page.
