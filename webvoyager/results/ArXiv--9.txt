- Abstract (excerpt): Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, particularly node injection attacks. … We propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called JANUS, aligning local feature manifolds and global structured latent variables, optimized with a reinforcement learning agent. Experiments show significant improvements in both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.
