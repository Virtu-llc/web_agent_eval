The screenshot and the result response both confirm that the Heart Rate Reserve is 110 bpm using the Karvonen heart rate reserve formula. Therefore, the task was successfully completed."}
{"id": "Wolfram Alpha--42", "webname": "Wolfram Alpha", "result": "SUCCESS", "reason": "The task asked for the raw memory of a true color picture of size 100.2\" by 123.5\" at 72 ppi. The response provided the calculation and result: 1.925×10^8 bytes, 192.5 MB, and 183.5 MiB. The screenshot confirms these results, demonstrating that the task was executed correctly."}
{"id": "Wolfram Alpha--43", "webname": "Wolfram Alpha", "result": "SUCCESS", "reason": "The task was to determine the number of two-sided hexominoes and count how many of them have only 2 rows. The response correctly states that there are 35 hexominoes, as seen in the screenshot under the 'Count' pod. Additionally, it states 10 have only 2 rows, and the screenshot shows an array of hexominoes allowing such a count, fulfilling both parts of the task."}
{"id": "Wolfram Alpha--44", "webname": "Wolfram Alpha", "result": "SUCCESS", "reason": "The task was to solve the ODE g' + cos(g) = 0 with the condition g(0) = 1. The response and the screenshot both show that the input was correctly provided to Wolfram Alpha, and the result g(x) was obtained. The solution respects the initial condition g(0) = 1, and there is no arbitrary constant, which is consistent with the instruction. Therefore, the task was completed successfully."}
{"id": "Wolfram Alpha--45", "webname": "Wolfram Alpha", "result": "FAILED", "reason": "The web task was not accomplished because Wolfram|Alpha did not provide any results for the query due to the JavaScript issue. No metabolic properties were retrieved or summarized."}
